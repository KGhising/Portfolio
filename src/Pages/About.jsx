              I have been a huge supporter of eSport and I loved to play FPP games like cs:go, valorant, pubg

              I started my career as a software engineer intern and later discovered a passion for design. I began 
              learning design through books, articles, different platforms like dribbble, behance and design 
              communities. I try to focus on accessibility and inclusiveness while designing a product for people.
