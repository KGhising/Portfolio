              I have been a huge supporter of eSport and I loved to play FPP games like cs:go, valorant, pubg 
              and list goes on. Iâ€™m also interested in football and hiking.

              I started my career as a software engineer intern and later discovered a passion for design. I began 
              learning design through books, articles, and different platforms like dribbble, behance & design 
              communities.
